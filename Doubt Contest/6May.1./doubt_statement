At place of condition it is written only i
N at place of updation it is
i>>=1
Ans-> If you break i>>=1 ,you have i....>>==...1
      Here you get >>== as the bitwise operator and 1 as the operand.
      '>>='This is a bitwise right shift assignment operator.
      Just like  "i+=3" -> does i=i+3----->"i>>=3" does i=i>>1.
      In this case, as the code is given as i>>=1;  i is divide by 2 in every iteratin of the loop.
      Therefore-The loop is executed 11 times, after which the value of i becomes 0,and the condition in for is not satisfied. 
     Loop no.     i
